## Explanication of volume similarity

There is more than one definations for the volume similarity. 

1. The first defination is:
$VS = 1 - \frac{|V_{pred}−V_{gdth}|}{V_{pred}+V_{gdth}}$ where $V_{pred}$ is the volume of prediction and $V_{gdth}$ is the volume of the ground truth. This defination is from [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4533825/#:~:text=Volume%20based%20metrics,the%20segments%20to%20indicate%20similarity.). It ranges from 0 to 1. Higher value means the size (volume) of the prediction is more similar (close) with the size (volume) of the ground truth.

2. The second defination is:
$VS = \frac{2∗(V_{pred}−V_{gdth})}{V_{pred}+V_{gdth}}$. This defination is from [SimpleITK](http://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/R_html/34_Segmentation_Evaluation.html). Negative VS means the volume of prediction is less than the volume of ground truth, which is called **underestimation**. Positive VS means the volume of prediction is greater than the volume of the ground truth, which is called **overestimation**.



**In our package `seg_metrics`, we implemented the ${\color{red}second}$ defination**.

Note: **None** of the two equations not represent overlap information. VS only represent the volume size difference between prediction and ground truth.

## Explanication of  surface distance based metrics

For each contour voxel of the segmented volume `A`, the Euclidean distance from the closest contour voxel of the reference volume `B` is computed and stored as `list1`. This computation is also performed for the contour voxels of the reference volume `B`, stored as `list2`. `list1` and `list2` are merged to get `list3`.
- `Hausdorff distance` is the maximum value of `list3`. 
- `Hausdorff distance 95% percentile` is the 95% percentile of `list3`. 
- `Mean (Average) surface distance` is the mean value of `list3`.
- `Median surface distance` is the median value of `list3`.
- `Std surface distance` is the standard deviation of `list3`.
